# Investigation Status Update

## Law Enforcement Case Status

### Current Status
- USSS Case: Closed
- LVMPD Case: Closed

### Key Findings (As of September 16)

#### ChangeNow Investigation
- Funds were combined with other transactions
- Money was potentially distributed across multiple accounts
- Trail becomes too diluted to meet criminal prosecution standards
- ChangeNow, being a non-custodial exchange, maintains no user information

#### Tornado Cash Investigation
- Tracing through Tornado Cash involves assumptions that cannot meet prosecutorial standards
- Law enforcement unable to pursue further action through this avenue

## Technical Investigation Challenges

### Exchange Platform Limitations
1. ChangeNow's non-custodial nature means:
   - No personal information collected on users
   - Limited transaction tracking capabilities
   - No KYC requirements for certain transactions

### Mixing Service Complications
1. Tornado Cash usage creates significant barriers:
   - Fund mixing makes definitive tracing impossible
   - Cannot meet evidence standards for prosecution
   - Multiple account distributions further complicate tracking

## Current Options

### Civil Actions
- Civil investigation routes may be available
- Private investigation services could be considered
- Different evidentiary standards may apply

### Continuing Documentation
- Maintaining comprehensive evidence collection
- Preserving all transaction records
- Keeping investigation findings organized
